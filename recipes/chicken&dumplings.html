    <img src="../images/C&D.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Any time there is a slight chill in the air, you can guess what I am making for dinner…Chicken and Dumplings. 
        It’s the perfect stick to your ribs kind of dinner that my whole family loves and begs me to make often.
        We start with a creamy chicken soup base, loaded with big chunks of chicken, carrots, celery, onion. 
        Then we add some big fluffy dumplings to round it out. This recipe is made in just 30 minutes or less, from start to finish, so what are you waiting for?!</p>
